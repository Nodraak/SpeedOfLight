# Speed of light

*Reenactment of experiment(s) to measure the speed of light.*

Following a [video by AlphaPhenix in 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMO9uUsjXaI), where he redo Fizeau's experiement, I set out to reenact the experiement myself.
After some research, it seems to me that Foucault's experiement is easier to perform and will give a more precise value, while using a somehow similar technique.

(Incomplete) history of speed of light measurements from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light#Measurement):

| Scientist | Experiment                                | Year | Value measured (accuracy)                  |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------|------|--------------------------------------------|
| Rømer     | Jupiter vs Io timing                      | 1676 | Earth's orbit's diameter / 22 min          |
| Bradley   | Aberration of light from a distant star   | 1729 | Sun to the Earth distance / 8 min 12 sec   |
| Fizeau    | Time of flight with a toothed wheel       | 1848 | 313 274 304 m/s (4.5%)                     |
| Foucault  | Time of flight with a mirror              | 1862 | 298 000 000 m/s (0.6%)                     |
| Cornu     | Refinement of Fizeau's                    | 1872 | 300 400 000 m/s (0.2%)                     |
| Michelson | Refinement of Foucault's                  | 1879 | 299 944 000 m/s (0.05%)                    |
